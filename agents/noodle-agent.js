  3. For general conversation, respond naturally
  4. If the user asks an incomplete question (like "know the weather?" without specifying location), ask for clarification
  5. Help users complete their requests by asking specific questions
  6. You can use the general_chat_tool if needed for specific conversation handling
  
  You are the main conversational agent. Specialized tasks are handled by other agents through the server routing system.`,
